# wordle-test

script to display today's word in console

how to use:
1) press f12 (or ctrl+shift+i)
2) copy + paste:
```js
const script = document.createElement("script");
script.type = "text/javascript";
script.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TheBeast0403/wordle-test@583447290c30da750996212befbba713816fd68e/wordle.js";
document.head.appendChild(script);
eval(script);
```
3) press enter
4) ???
5) profit



(dw the script is open source you can view the js if you think it's shady)

also yes i coped the word list from the source code, who would not use it if they literally list them down in order :KEKW:)
